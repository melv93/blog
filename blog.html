        <h3 class="post-title">End of Term and Passwords</h3>
        <div class="post-content">
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>End of Term!</p>
              <p>Finally, this term is over. Not sure it'll be the most restful break ever but at least a chance to not be in school for a couple of weeks. A few lie in's here and there wouldn't go amis either. Sleep is, as always, greatly missed! </p>
              <p>Nothing is particularly ready for the beginning of next term which does mean some work to be done over this holiday but shouldn't require too much brainpower or effort to complete in time.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Passwords</p>
              <p>So I managed to make a password encrypter. Any half decent hacker worth their salt (pun intended) could break it in 30 seconds flat but still! A little bit of salting and some Caeser Cypher and the hash result is quite pleasing, even if the password is reverse engineerable.</p>
              <p>I can't quite get my head around how a password would not be reverse engineerable as any algorithm can usually be worked backwards. This must somehow involve a many to 1 relationship that has only one possible encrypting result but multiple decryption results without reducing the number of possible results by a significant factor.</p>
              <p>Something to look at in the future maybe.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Well this has been a relatively long one. Still can't work out why the matrices program won't load on the school system and need to test it out on another computer at some point to see if it is school security or something wrong with the coding. When I'm home maybe.</p>

        <h3 class="post-title">New House</h3>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Well it's been an interesting few months. After 4 months of chasing solicitors and panic phonecalls to the parents asking for money, I am now the owner of a house!</p>
          <p> Having almost unpacked and settled into the new place it is already feeling comfortable and the ideas for what I can do with the place are building up.</p>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>The shower needs repapering and having a curtain put in.</li>
              <li>The desk can be extended (finally) so that I have room for both the computer and the other work that I need to do</li>
              <li>Pictures! Pictures everywhere!!</li>
              <li>New sofa to fit the slightly oddly shaped lounge.</li>
              <li>So much more!</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>Funny part is after an incredibly long and stressful term, this has actually revitalised me and made me want to start doing 'stuff' again which can only be good!</p>
          <p>Well... to the future then...</p>

        <h3 class="post-title">Testing My Website</h3>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>So after a lot of java script programming, I am finally going to start to code in HTML and create a webpage. Hopefully this will lead to publishing a webpage properly and learning how to share my games and creations online.</p>
          <p>I'm going to use <a href="https://mimo.com">Mimo</a> for now to help learn this but I'm not convinced it is actually going to help me understand what is going on with the element tags etc due to its multiple choice/obvious choice layout.</p>
