        <h3 class="post-title">New House</h3>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Well it's been an interesting few months. After 4 months of chasing solicitors and panic phonecalls to the parents asking for money, I am now the owner of a house!</p>
          <p> Having almost unpacked and settled into the new place it is already feeling comfortable and the ideas for what I can do with the place are building up.</p>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>The shower needs repapering and having a curtain put in.</li>
              <li>The desk can be extended (finally) so that I have room for both the computer and the other work that I need to do</li>
              <li>Pictures! Pictures everywhere!!</li>
              <li>New sofa to fit the slightly oddly shaped lounge.</li>
              <li>So much more!</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>Funny part is after an incredibly long and stressful term, this has actually revitalised me and made me want to start doing 'stuff' again which can only be good!</p>
          <p>Well... to the future then...</p>

        <h3 class="post-title">Testing My Website</h3>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>So after a lot of java script programming, I am finally going to start to code in HTML and create a webpage. Hopefully this will lead to publishing a webpage properly and learning how to share my games and creations online.</p>
          <p>I'm going to use <a href="https://mimo.com">Mimo</a> for now to help learn this but I'm not convinced it is actually going to help me understand what is going on with the element tags etc due to its multiple choice/obvious choice layout.</p>
